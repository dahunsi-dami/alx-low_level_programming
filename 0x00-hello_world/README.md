<p>This directory contains bash scripts that I wrote under <em>Project 0x00. C - Hello, World</em>.</p>

<p>This directory and its parent repository documents my first introduction to the C programming language</p>

<p>Here is an explanation of what each script does:</p>

The C file name will be saved in the variable $CFILE
The output should be saved in the file c</p>
